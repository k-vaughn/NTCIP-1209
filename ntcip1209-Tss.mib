DESCRIPTION
"<Definition> A software interface to initiate a reset of various functions of
the TSS. Upon receiving a request to set this object, the TSS shall follow the
state transition rules defined in Section 4.3.1. Upon completing the processing
of a successful set, the TSS shall transition the value of this object back to
'noResetInProgress'.
The reset values are described as follows:
      restart(1) - This command shall cause the unit to enter restart state
      and go through a complete shut-down and start-up process, causing a
      reset and initialization of the number of seconds since most recent
      TSS initialization to a value of zero.
      reinitializeUserSettings(2) - This command shall cause the unit to 
      flush all memory and reinitialize all settings to their user-defined 
      default values, and reset and initialize the number of seconds since 
      most recent TSS initialization to a value of zero.
      restoreFactoryDefaults(3) - This command shall cause the unit to flush
      all memory, restore all settings to their factory default values, and
      reset and initialize the number of seconds since most recent TSS
      initialization to a value of zero.
      retune(4) - This command recalibrates unit background settings for all
      zones without resetting or flushing of any collected data.
      resyncSamplingPeriods(5) - This command shall cause the unit to
      synchronize all startup sampling period clocks within one (1) second of
      receiving the command and a reset and initialize of the number of
      seconds since most recent TSS initialization to a value of zero.
      shortDiagnostics(6) - This command shall cause the unit to go through
      an abbreviated vendor-specific diagnostic routine which may be the same
      as full diagnostics for some vendors.
      fullDiagnostics(7) - This command shall cause the unit to go through
      a complete vendor-specific diagnostic routine which may be the same as
      short diagnostics for some vendors, causing a reset and initialization
      of the number of seconds since most recent TSS initialization to a
      value of zero.
      executePendingConfiguration(8) - The behavior of this command is
      dependent upon type of configuration file uploaded and is manufacturer-
      specific. Execution may result in a system reboot, reinitialization,
      and loss of historical data.
      abortPendingConfiguration(9) - This command shall cause the TSS
      to cancel the currently pending configuration changes.
      validatePendingConfiguration(10) - This command is used to check the
      configuration to ensure that it is a valid configuration file.
      noResetInProgress(11) - No command is in-progress. The TSS shall 
      automatically transition this object back to this state upon 
      completion of the requested command. This value is read-only.
<Parameter Type> Control
<Informative> The value 'restart' (1) was deprecated in v03 in favor of using 
  fdCtrlReset. If the value 1 is supported, it shall act the same as setting 
  fdCtrlReset to 'true'.

      disabled(8) - Indicates that the zone is disabled.
      overrideActive(9) - Indicates an override is active.
      sensorFailure(10) - Indicates a sensing element failure.
      inputDataIntegrity(11) - Indicates input values are not sufficient to
      determine detector data accurately (e.g., bad communications, invalid
      video for machine vision)
      poorContrast(12) - Indicates insufficient contrast error condition.
      detectionAutoSuspended(13) - Indicates that the detection zone was
      automatically disabled by the TSS (e.g., camera is on a PTZ and
      was moved).
      pairedZoneFault(14) - Indicates that there was no problem with this
      zone, but a zone that it is paired with had a fault. This may affect
      the accuracy of data reported by this zone.
If a condition occurs during the sample period, then that state remains for the
duration of that sample period. If multiple conditions occur during a sample
period, the last reported condition, other than OK, is retained.

"<Definition> This allows other devices to modify the states of the Arming

envisioned that the first 24 bits would correspond to the Greens, Yellows, and
Reds of phases 1 through 8 from the traffic signal controller. The last 8 bits
would be used for other phases, overlaps, or special functions. If the Arming
Pin inputs are DC then a low input is an ON and a high input is an OFF. If the
Arming Pin inputs are AC then a low input is an OFF and a high input is an ON.

DESCRIPTION
"<Definition> This parameter identifies the sensorZoneNumber of an upstream
directional zone. The output for this entry shall only become active if the
zone is actuated when the upstream directional zone has an active output. The
output for this entry shall not activate for any actuation (or during the

have an active output. This entry shall report each new actuation that occurs
while the upstream directional zone output remains active. 
<Parameter Type> Configuration 
<Informative> This parameter allows the creation of directional detection. The
intent is that the two zones are in close enough proximity that a vehicle is
able to be detected by both zones and that the last zone to detect the vehicle
is the one that activates its output.

A report of an actuation may not result in an active output if other
configuration parameters prevent the activation (e.g., an actuation with a
occupancy that is shorter than sensorZoneOutputDelayTime).

MAX-ACCESS  read-write
STATUS  current
DESCRIPTION
"<Definition> This allows other devices to modify the states of the Arming
Input Bits used by the TSS. There are separate clears and sets so that
individual Arming Input Bits can be managed by different management stations.
While the inputs are physically configured within each deployment, it is
envisioned that the first 24 bits will typically correspond to the Greens,
Yellows, and Reds of phases 1 through 8 from the traffic signal controller
leaving the remaining 8 bits for other phases, overlaps, or special functions.
If the Arming Pin inputs are DC then a low input is an ON and a high input is
an OFF. If the Arming Pin inputs are AC then a low input is an OFF and a high
input is an ON.
An attempt to write to this object with a value that has an Arming Input
configured to both Clear and Set (e.g., Bits 0 and 32 are set) shall result in
a 'wrongValue' error. A read of this object shall return the last value
written. 
<Format>
For Bits 0-31 of the ITSBitmap: Bit x = Clear Arming Input Bit x + 1;
For Bits 32-63 of the ITSBitmap: Bit x = Set Arming Input Bit x - 31
<Informative> For example, for the value 0x80 00 00 00 04 00 00 00, 
 - Bit 0 is set indicating that Arming Input Bit 1 is cleared and 
 - Bit 33 is set indicating that Arming Input Bit 2 is set
<Parameter Type> Configuration 
<Informative> For example, two management stations can coordinate so that the
first management station agrees to only use (set or clear) bits associated with
arming inputs 1 and 2 while the other management station agrees to not use the
bits associated with those two arming inputs.

"<Definition> Consists of up to 16 physical Arming Pins to the TSS and up to 32
bits of external arming bits which can be controlled through this protocol. The
Arming Pins have historically been connected to the phase greens but can be
used for any purpose. It is envisioned that the phase green information could
be sent through Arming Input Bits using the protocol and eliminate the need for
additional wiring. If the Arming Pin inputs are DC then a low input is an ON
and a high input is an OFF. If the Arming Pin inputs are AC then a low input is
an OFF and a high input is an ON.

"<Definition> Consists of up to 16 physical Arming Pins to the TSS and up to 32
external arming bits which can be controlled through this protocol. The Arming
Pins have historically been connected to the phase greens but can be used for
any purpose. It is envisioned that the phase green information could be sent
through Arming Input Bits using the protocol and eliminate the need for
additional wiring. If the Arming Pin inputs are DC then a low input is an ON
and a high input is an OFF. If the Arming Pin inputs are AC then a low input is
an OFF and a high input is an ON.

SYNTAX  SEQUENCE OF SampleDataEntry
MAX-ACCESS  not-accessible
STATUS  current
DESCRIPTION 
"<Definition> Table containing the historical sample period data. The number of
rows in this table is equal to the maxSensorZones data element multiplied by
the maxSampleDataEntries data element multiplied by the maximum number of
claseses that can be specified (i.e., the maximum value of
numSensorZoneClasses). Table rows are set by the manufacturer, and row
creation/deletion is not supported; however, only the rows indicated by the
zoneSequenceTable will contain valid data.

When a new historical data entry begins for a zone, the value of sampleEntryNum
increments for each row associated with that zone; if the new value of
sampleEntryNum exceeds maxSampleDataEntries, the row is discarded. To
retrieve all historical data entries for a zone, the oldest valid historical
data entry (i.e., as identified by a sampleEntryNum being equal to
numSampleDataEntries for the zone) should be retrieved first (i.e., before it
is discarded). Earlier entries can then be retrieved in order.

A historical data entry consists of all rows with the same pair of values for
sensorZoneNumber and sampleSequenceNumber; however, rows are retrieved by
sensorZoneNumber and sampleEntryNum. Because a new sample period can shift rows
within the table, the management station should verify that the
sampleSequenceNumber is as is expected and to adjust its requests if not. 
<Informative> A sequence number is used rather than end time because the system
clock can be reset between data samples.

These sensitivity definitions are equal with a loop inductance of 80
microhenry. A detector need not support all of these settings. However, the
sensitivities it does support are required to conform with these definitions,
e.g. a sensitivity setting of 3 is always 128 nanohenry or 0.16% with an 80
microhenry loop. 

A value of 0xFFFF =(65535) shall indicate invalid data or not a physical zone.
Otherwise, if the high-order bit of the first octet is set, the remaining bits
indicate the sensitivity in nanohenry or one-thousands of a percent (depending
on the value in zoneSensitivityMode), e.g. a value of 0x8E42 = (high-bit set +

quality may mean smaller more compressed images. Some image formats do not
support variable image quality so the value is ignored. If a manufacturer
supports only two image qualities for a specific image format then values 1 to
50 should select the lower quality while values 51 to 100 should select the
higher quality.
